Cravings - Food Delivery Application
Cravings is a full-stack web application designed to provide a seamless food ordering and delivery experience. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, the app allows users to browse menus, add food items to their cart, place orders, and track their deliveries in real-time.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Browse Menu: Users can browse various food categories and view detailed information about menu items.
Add to Cart: Items can be easily added or removed from the cart with real-time updates.
Order Management: Users can place orders, and their order details are stored in MongoDB.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, providing a great experience across devices.
Backend APIs: RESTful APIs built with Node.js and Express for handling user authentication, fetching menu items, and managing orders.
State Management: Efficient state management in React using Context API for global state access.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (for dynamic and responsive user interface)
Backend: Node.js & Express.js (for handling backend logic and APIs)
Database: MongoDB (to store user information, menu items, and order details)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions
